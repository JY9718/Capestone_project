# Capestone_project

Project Description

This repository is made for the capestone project for the Certifiacte of Machine Learning and Data Science program.
The challenge is to build a Bayesian Optimization model that  aimed at maximizing 8 unknown synthetic functions with different dimensinos. These functions are black-boxes, and we are only allowed to query them once a week. The goal is to strategically choose input values to maximize these functions, leveraging a Gaussian Process model and acquisition functions.
